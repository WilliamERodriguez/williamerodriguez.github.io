        <h2>Linux Fundamentals Lab</h2>
        <p>
            A structured virtual environment used to practice and document core Linux system concepts.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
            This project was created to build hands-on familiarity with Linux systems in an isolated environment, allowing experimentation without risk to a primary system. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic file system navigation</li>
            <li>User accounts and permissions</li>
            <li>Process monitoring and management</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
            A Linux virtual machine was configured and used as a sandbox environment. Tasks were performed manually to reinforce understanding of system behavior and command-line tools. Notes were recorded to document observations and repeatable steps.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux (Fedora / Debian-based distribution)</li>
            <li>Bash Shell</li>
            <li>Virtualization Software</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            This project improved familiarity with Linux system structure and increased confidence working with the command line. It also established a repeatable process for experimenting with system-level concepts safely.
