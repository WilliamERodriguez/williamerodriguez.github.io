        <h1>Projects</h1>

        <p>
            The projects listed here focus on applying foundational Linux and IT concepts in
            controlled, repeatable environments. Each project emphasizes system understanding,
            documentation, and practical problem-solving rather than production deployment.
        </p>

        <h2>Linux Fundamentals Lab</h2>

        <p>
            A structured learning environment used to practice and document core Linux system
            concepts through hands-on experimentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project was created to build familiarity with Linux systems in an isolated
            environment, allowing experimentation without risk to a primary system. Work is
            performed directly from the command line to reinforce understanding of system behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>File system navigation and layout</li>
            <li>User accounts and file permissions</li>
            <li>Basic process monitoring and management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
            A Linux virtual machine is used as a sandbox environment. Tasks are performed manually
            to observe how the system responds to commands and configuration changes. Notes are
            recorded to document observations and repeatable steps.
        </p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux (Fedora or Debian-based distributions)</li>
            <li>Bash shell</li>
            <li>Virtualization software</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project is ongoing and serves as a foundation for continued system-level learning.
